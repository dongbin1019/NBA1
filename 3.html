<h2>Giannis Antetokounmpo</h2>
<br>In 2016â€“17 he led the Bucks in all five major statistical categories and became the first player in NBA history to finish a regular season in the top 20 in all five statistics of total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.[3] He received the Most Improved Player award in 2017. He has received four All-Star selections, including being selected as the Eastern Conference captain for 2020, and led the Eastern Conference in voting in 2019. In June 2019, he was named the NBA Most Valuable Player.Antetokounmpo was born in Athens, Greece, on December 6, 1994, the son of immigrants from Nigeria. Three years earlier, his parents had moved from Lagos, leaving behind their firstborn son, Francis, with his grandparents.[7] Though Antetokounmpo and three of his four brothers were born in Greece, they did not automatically receive full Greek citizenship as the Greek nationality law abides by the jus sanguinis.[5] For the first 18 years of his life Antetokounmpo was effectively stateless, having no papers from Nigeria or Greece.Antetokounmpo grew up in the Athens neighborhood of Sepolia.[6] His parents, as immigrants, could not easily find work, so Antetokounmpo and his older brother, Thanasis, helped by hawking watches, handbags and sunglasses in the streets.[9] In 2007, Antetokounmpo started playing basketball,[8] and was playing competitively for the youth squad of Filathlitikos by 2009.
